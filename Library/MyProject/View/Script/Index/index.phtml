<h2>Hello from the Index/Index View Script!</h2>

<p class="success">Since you are seeing this your MVC is setup correctly - congratulations!</p>

<p>Just a recap to remind you that you can change this Layout in the <code>/Library/MyProject/Layout/default.phtml</code> file, edit Controllers in the <code>/Library/MyProject/Controller/</code> directory, and View Scripts in the <code>/Library/MyProject/View/Script/</code> directory.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Testing View Helpers:</h3>

<p>
	You can call View Helpers in this context:
	<?=$this->test(['testVar' => 'Hello from the Test View Helper!'])?>
</p>

<h3>Safely output user supplied data:</h3>

<p>
	You can also securely output potentially dangerous output:
	<?=$this->safe(['string' => '<script>alert("Hello World!");</script>'])?>
</p>

<h3>Passing variables to the View from the Controller:</h3>

<?php if ($foo): ?>
	<p>
		The <var>$foo</var> variable was set in the Controller, and its value is:
		<?=$this->safe(['string' => $foo])?>
	</p>
<?php else: ?>
	<p>
		Oh dear, <var>$foo</var> isn't set.
		<a href="<?=$this->url(['variables' => ['foo' => 'bar']])?>">Click here to pass it in via the URL.</a>
	</p>
<?php endif; ?>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
